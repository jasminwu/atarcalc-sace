# ATAR Calculator

This ATAR Calculator is a command-line-interface program designed to estimate your ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) using 2021 SACE (South Australian Certificate of Education) data.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Recognised Learning:** Start by inputting any recognized learning you have completed, such as Headstart or VET Course. This will be taken into account during the ATAR calculation.

2. **Enter Subject Scores:** Provide your scores for 10-credit and 20-credit subjects. These scores will be used to calculate your university aggregate.

3. **Calculate Aggregate:** The program will determine the optimal combination of subjects, totaling 90 credits, ensuring that only 20 credits of recognized learning will count. This aggregate score will be used for further calculations.

4. **Predict ATAR:** Your aggregate score will be compared with the information in `saceData.xlsx` (using the 2021 conversion) to generate a predicted ATAR.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/atarcalc-matlab.git
```

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the ATARCalc.m file.
4. Follow the instructions provided by the program to input your recognized learning and subject scores.
5. Once all the required data is provided, the program will display the predicted ATAR.

## Requirements

    MATLAB R2018b or later.

## Credits

The ATAR Calculator program utilizes the 2021 SACE data conversion from saceData.xlsx. The conversion data is included in the repository.
